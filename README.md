# api-project

This is a web application that fetches and displays a list of Pokémon items using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Users can click on an item from the list to see its image, effect, and cost. Users can also search for an item if they know the number or name. Just remember to put a - in between two word names to return the items information.
